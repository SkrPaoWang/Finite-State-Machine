	Scrum Mark: 100 / 100 (equally weighted from above)


P1Q1: 
	GUI: 1 / 2
	POLYLINE: 8 / 8
        -------------------------------------
	P1Q1 Mark: 9 / 10 (sum of above)

P1Q2: 
	Note: Save includes the mark for both passing our
	tests as well as a few points related to
	code quality.

	Save: 1 / 8 
        -------------------------------------
	P1Q2 Mark: 1  / 5

P1Q3: 
	Note: Load includes marks for both passing our
	tests as well as for code quality. 
	We specifically looked for whether you stuck
	to the FSM, without combining states, as well
	as whether you captured some concepts. For example,
	creating a function which parses Color, a function which
	parses Filled: See the solution code.

	Load: 8.5 / 10
        -------------------------------------
	P1Q3 Mark: 8.5 / 10

Bonus: 
	We were very particular about this question. 
	We only gave marks for this if your solution 
	was very similar to ours. See the solution code.

	Bonus Mark: 0 / 5


P2:     For more details, please see the marks.txt file.

	FP: 9 / 9
        -------------------------------------
	P2 Mark: 9 / 9

A3: To calculate this, we took your SCRUM
	mark and weighed it 10% of P1Q1, P1Q2 and P1Q3.
	We then added in all of the other marks for
	a mark out of 34.

	A3: 28 / 34
        -------------------------------------
	A3 Mark: 82 / 100
